Simulation of an island with animals

Simulation conditions:

1. The animal searches for prey.
 1.1. If it does not find any:
  - satiety decreases with each tick;
  - as soon as satiety falls below 0, the hunger counter increases with each tick;
  - if the counter falls below 2 or the animal's satiety has not reached its maximum for several ticks, the animal moves to another location;
  - if the hunger counter exceeds the limit, the animal dies of starvation;
 1.2. If found:
  - If more than 75% full, it looks for a mate to reproduce.
  - If below 75% to above 0, it looks for prey on the next tick.
Exception: plants and caterpillars reproduce (random) on their own within a single location.
2. There may be a limited number of animals in a location.
3. Animals die as a result of aging.
